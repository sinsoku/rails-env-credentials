# RailsEnvCredentials

It enhances the Credentials feature introduced by Rails v5.2.0.

## Installation

Add this line to your Rails application's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :development, :test do
  gem 'rails-env-credentials'
end
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

## Usage

RailsEnvCredentials manages credentials and key pairs with the following:

```
config/credentials-development.yml.enc
config/credentials-test.yml.enc
config/credentials.yml.enc
master-development.key
master-test.key
master.key
```

It also manages environment variables for each env.

```
RAILS_MASTER_KEY_DEVELOPMENT
RAILS_MASTER_KEY_TEST
RAILS_MASTER_KEY
```

You can use appropriate credentials depending on `Rails.env`.

```console
$ rails env_credentials:show -e development
# config/credentials-development.yml.enc
aws:
  bucket: foo-dev

$ rails env_credentials:show -e production
# config/credentials.yml.enc
aws:
  bucket: foo-prod

$ rails runner -e development 'pp Rails.application.credentials.aws.bucket'
"foo-dev"
$ rails runner -e production 'pp Rails.application.credentials.aws.bucket'
"foo-prod"
```

## Generating secrets and a master key

It automatically generate encrypted file and the master key when you starts editing credentials at first:

```
$ rails env_credentials:edit -e development
```

## Show secrets

You want to see decrypted contents, use `env_credentials:show`:

```
$ rails env_credentials:show -e development
```

## Additional information

### Other environments support

For example, if the `config/environments/staging.rb` exists, you will generate `config/credentials-staging.yml.enc`.

```
$ rails env_credentials:edit -e staging
```

### Display a diff

You can’t directly compare encrypted files between two versions, but it turns out you can see a diff using Git attributes.

Put the following line in your `.gitattributes` file:

```
config/credentials*.yml.enc diff=env_credentials
```

Then configure Git to use `env_credentials:show`:

```
$ git config diff.env_credentials.textconv 'rails env_credentials:show --file'
```

This tells Git that encrypted files should decrypt by the `env_credentials:show` task when you try to display a diff.

## Why make this gem?

Credentials is a good feature, but we cannot use it on development and test environment.

DHH wrote as follow in the pull request for initial implementation:

However, I have to manage secrets and a master key different from production for testing in the staging environment.

I do not have the confidence to explain explicit use cases to Rails team, so I implemented as a gem.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
